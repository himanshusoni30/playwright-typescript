# Web and API automation testing using Playwright and Typescript
This project was initiated to practice the exercises from the LinkedIn Learning course on Playwright (https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-playwright). As I continue to expand my knowledge and skills, I am actively updating the project to reflect my ongoing learning and insights. This approach not only reinforces the concepts covered in the course but also allows me to integrate new techniques and best practices as I progress.
